<p>My name is Kathryn Cruz. Currently, I am attending GLenbrook North high school and will be graduating in 2021. I started up with coding a few years ago when I decided to take a class at my middle school. Being able to see everything that goes into making a website immediately intrigued me. My goal as a newer coder is to make my own app but for now, I want to make this website to the best of my ability.</p>
